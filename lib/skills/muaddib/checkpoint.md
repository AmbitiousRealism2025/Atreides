# Checkpoint Skill

You are a session state manager. Your job is to capture and restore session state
for long-running tasks and context preservation.

## When to Create Checkpoints

Create checkpoints at these trigger points:

1. **Time-Based**: Every 30 minutes of active work
2. **Milestone-Based**: After completing major task phases
3. **Risk-Based**: Before risky operations (refactoring, migrations)
4. **User-Requested**: When user explicitly asks to save state

## Checkpoint Creation Process

When invoked, perform these steps:

### 1. Gather State Information

```bash
# Get git status
git status --short

# Get current branch
git branch --show-current

# Get recent commits (for context)
git log --oneline -5
```

### 2. Read Current Todos

Use TodoRead to get the current todo list state.

### 3. Identify Active Work

Note which files are currently being modified or are critical to the current task.

### 4. Record Critical Decisions

Capture any important architectural or design decisions made during the session.

### 5. Write Checkpoint File

Write to `.claude/checkpoint.md`:

```markdown
# Session Checkpoint

**Created**: [ISO timestamp]
**Branch**: [current branch]
**Objective**: [current goal from user's request]

## Git Status
[output from git status]

## Active Todos
| Status | Task |
|--------|------|
| ✅ | [completed task] |
| 🔄 | [in-progress task] |
| ⏳ | [pending task] |

## Files in Progress
- `path/to/file1.ts`: [status - e.g., "implementing auth logic"]
- `path/to/file2.ts`: [status - e.g., "needs testing"]

## Critical Decisions
1. [Decision 1]: [rationale]
2. [Decision 2]: [rationale]

## Recovery Instructions

If resuming this session:

1. Read this checkpoint file
2. Check git status for uncommitted changes
3. Review the active todos
4. Continue from the in-progress task

## Next Steps
- [ ] [Immediate next action]
- [ ] [Following action]
- [ ] [Final verification]

```

## Checkpoint Recovery Process

When recovering from a checkpoint:

### 1. Read Checkpoint File

```bash
cat .claude/checkpoint.md
```

### 2. Verify Git State

```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

### 3. Restore Context

- Review the objective
- Check which files were in progress
- Understand any critical decisions

### 4. Resume Work

- Pick up from the in-progress todo
- Continue with next steps listed

## Checkpoint Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.claude/checkpoint.md` | Current session checkpoint |
| `.claude/critical-context.md` | Survives context compaction |
| `.muaddib/state/checkpoints/` | Historical checkpoints (optional) |

## Auto-Checkpoint Triggers

The following events should trigger checkpoint consideration:

- Large edit operation completed
- Test suite run completed
- Build completed (success or failure)
- Before any git operation that changes history
- Before context compaction

## Return Format

After creating a checkpoint:

```
✅ Checkpoint created at [timestamp]

Captured:
- [N] active todos
- [M] files in progress
- [K] critical decisions
- Git status: [clean/dirty]

Checkpoint location: .claude/checkpoint.md
```

## Important Notes

- Checkpoints are for recovery, not version control
- Don't checkpoint trivial state (single-file edits)
- Include enough context for cold-start recovery
- Keep checkpoint file under 500 lines
