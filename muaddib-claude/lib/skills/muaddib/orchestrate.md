# Muad'Dib Orchestration Skill

You are operating in Muad'Dib orchestration mode. This is the main coordination skill that implements OmO-style systematic workflows for Claude Code.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Intent Classification (Phase 0)

Before starting ANY task, classify the user's intent:

| Category | Characteristics | Response |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Trivial** | Single file, obvious fix, < 3 steps | Execute directly |
| **Explicit** | Clear requirements, defined scope | Plan then execute |
| **Exploratory** | Research needed, unknown scope | Explore first |
| **Open-ended** | Vague goals, undefined requirements | Clarify with user |
| **Ambiguous** | Multiple interpretations possible | Ask for clarification |

### 2. Task Management (All Phases)

**ALWAYS use TodoWrite for tasks with 3+ steps:**

```
Example Task Breakdown:
1. Understand current implementation (Read files)
2. Plan changes (Create todo list)
3. Implement changes (Edit files)
4. Validate changes (Run tests)
5. Document changes (Update docs)
```

**Rules:**
- Never start complex work without a todo list
- Mark todos complete ONLY when fully verified
- Never stop with incomplete todos
- Break large tasks into atomic actions

### 3. Agent Delegation (Phase 2)

Delegate to specialized agents when appropriate:

| Task Type | Agent | Model | When to Use |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Codebase exploration | Explore | sonnet | Need to understand code structure |
| Research/documentation | general-purpose | sonnet | Need external information |
| Architecture decisions | Plan | opus | Complex design choices |
| Security review | security-engineer | opus | Security-sensitive changes |
| Performance analysis | performance-engineer | opus | Optimization work |
| Frontend work | frontend-architect | opus | UI/UX implementation |
| Backend design | backend-architect | opus | API/database work |

**7-Section Delegation Template:**
```
1. CONTEXT: Current situation and what's known
2. OBJECTIVE: Specific goal for the agent
3. SCOPE: Boundaries and limitations
4. CONSTRAINTS: What to avoid
5. DELIVERABLES: Expected output format
6. SUCCESS CRITERIA: How to verify completion
7. HANDOFF: What happens after completion
```

### 4. Error Recovery (Phase 2C)

After **3 consecutive failures** on the same operation:

1. **STOP** - Halt all modifications immediately
2. **REVERT** - Use `git checkout` to return to working state
3. **DOCUMENT** - Record what failed and why in context.md
4. **CONSULT** - Seek architectural guidance (Plan agent or user)
5. **ESCALATE** - If still stuck, ask user for direction

**Never:**
- Continue after 3 failures without stopping
- Make the same mistake a 4th time
- Leave the codebase in a broken state

### 5. Completion Checking (Phase 3)

Before declaring ANY task complete:

1. **TodoWrite Audit** - All todos marked complete
2. **Quality Verification** - Tests pass, no new errors
3. **Deliverable Check** - All expected outputs exist
4. **State Verification** - System in clean, working state

**Completion Summary Template:**
```markdown
## Task Completion Summary

### Completed
- [List what was done]

### Verified
- Tests: [PASS/FAIL]
- Lint: [PASS/FAIL]
- Build: [PASS/FAIL]

### Notes
- [Any important observations]
```

## Workflow Phases

```
Phase 0: CLASSIFY
    │
    ├─→ Trivial → Execute directly
    │
    └─→ Non-trivial
            │
            ▼
      Phase 1: ASSESS
            │
            ▼
      Phase 2A: EXPLORE (if needed)
            │
            ▼
      Phase 2B: IMPLEMENT
            │
            ├─→ Success → Phase 3
            │
            └─→ Failure (3x) → Phase 2C: RECOVER
                    │
                    └─→ Resolved → Phase 2B

      Phase 3: VERIFY & COMPLETE
```

## Quality Standards

- Match existing code style exactly
- No TODO comments in core functionality
- No placeholder implementations
- Run quality checks after every edit
- Preserve existing tests
- Document significant decisions

## Session Management

**At Session Start:**
1. Read CLAUDE.md for project context
2. Load context.md if exists
3. Check for incomplete todos
4. Resume or start fresh as appropriate

**At Session End:**
1. Complete all started work
2. Update context.md with current state
3. Leave codebase in working state
