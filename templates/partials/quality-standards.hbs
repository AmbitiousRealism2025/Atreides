## Quality Standards

### Code Quality

- Match existing style exactly (indentation, naming, patterns)
- No TODO comments for core functionality
- No placeholder implementations - complete or don't start
- Run formatters and linters after edits

### Testing Requirements

- Run existing tests before and after changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Don't modify tests to make them pass
- If tests fail, fix the code, not the tests

### Documentation

- Update relevant docs when changing behavior
- Add comments only for non-obvious logic
- Keep README updated
- Document architectural decisions

### Version Control

- Check git status before starting work
- Commit frequently with meaningful messages
- Create feature branches for larger changes
- Never commit directly to main/master

### Quality Checklist

Before marking work complete:

- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Linter passes
- [ ] Documentation updated (if needed)
- [ ] No debug code or console.logs left behind
- [ ] Changes reviewed for security issues
