## Orchestration Rules

### Task Management

#### TodoWrite Rules

1. **Use TodoWrite for any task with 3+ steps**
   - Track progress visibly
   - Break complex work into atomic items
   - Provide user visibility into progress

2. **Mark todos complete only when fully verified**
   - Code compiles/runs
   - Tests pass (if applicable)
   - Quality checks pass
   - Deliverable matches requirement

3. **Never stop with incomplete todos**
   - Continue until all items done
   - Or explicitly blocked and documented
   - User must see clear status

4. **Break complex work into atomic tasks**
   - One clear deliverable per todo
   - Verifiable completion criteria
   - Independent when possible

#### Atomic Task Definition

Each todo item must have:
- **Single deliverable**: One thing that gets done
- **Clear completion**: Know when it's finished
- **Verifiable outcome**: Can prove it worked

#### Examples

**Good Todo Items**:
- "Create user authentication endpoint"
- "Add validation for email field"
- "Write tests for login flow"
- "Fix type error in utils.ts:45"

**Bad Todo Items**:
- "Work on authentication" (too vague)
- "Fix stuff" (not specific)
- "Make it better" (not verifiable)
- "Various improvements" (not atomic)

### Error Recovery Protocol

#### 3-Strikes Rule

After **3 consecutive failures** on the same operation, execute recovery protocol.

```
Strike 1 → Attempt operation
Strike 2 → Retry with adjustments
Strike 3 → Retry again
         │
         ▼ (3rd failure)
    ┌─────────┐
    │  STOP   │ → Halt all modifications immediately
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌─────────┐
    │ REVERT  │ → git checkout (return to last working state)
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌─────────┐
    │DOCUMENT │ → Record what was attempted and what failed
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌─────────┐
    │ CONSULT │ → Task(Plan, opus) for alternative strategy
    └────┬────┘
         │
    ┌─────────┐
    │ESCALATE │ → AskUserQuestion if still stuck
    └─────────┘
```

#### Recovery Actions Explained

| Action | What To Do |
|--------|------------|
| **STOP** | Immediately halt all file modifications. Do not attempt any more changes. |
| **REVERT** | Run `git checkout .` or `git checkout <file>` to restore last working state. |
| **DOCUMENT** | In your response, clearly state: what was attempted, what failed, error messages. |
| **CONSULT** | Use `Task(subagent_type="Plan", model="opus")` to get alternative approach. |
| **ESCALATE** | Use `AskUserQuestion` to get user guidance on how to proceed. |

#### What Counts as a Failure

- Edit operation fails (string not found)
- Build/compile fails
- Tests fail after changes
- Type checking fails
- Lint errors not resolvable
- Command returns error code
- File operation errors

#### What Does NOT Reset Strike Count

- Trying a different approach to same problem
- Making small adjustments to failing code
- Retrying with minor modifications

#### What DOES Reset Strike Count

- Moving to a completely different task
- User provides new direction
- Successfully completing an operation
- Explicit user override

#### Never Allowed

- Continue hoping errors will resolve
- Delete or skip failing tests
- Ignore type errors or warnings
- Leave code in broken state
- Make changes without understanding context
- Commit broken code

### Context Management

- Read CLAUDE.md at session start
- Update .claude/context.md for persistent state
- Use .claude/checkpoint.md for long-running tasks
- Check .claude/critical-context.md after compaction
- Preserve context across session boundaries
